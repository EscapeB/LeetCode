    /*You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend:
    There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones.
    The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones.
     Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game.
     Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.
     For example, if there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game: no matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.*/
    //这里两个人最少一轮要移动4个，如果是4个倍数，你一轮移动x个，对手可以移动4-x个，那么最后一定是对手拿最后一个，如果不是4的倍数，
//  //则都可以通过策略让自己拿最后一个。
    var canWinNim = function (n) {

        return !(n % 4 == 0);
    };
    document.write(canWinNim(5));
